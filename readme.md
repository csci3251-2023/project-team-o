## Introduction

**Please read `tasks.md` to start your work.**

In this project, we will be assigning different roles to team members:

The **_Task Manager_** is responsible for creating new issues with appropriate labels and monitoring the status of the issues and closing them once they have been resolved.

The **_Project Manager_** is responsible for creating a new project board (using the Basic Kanban template) and establishing workflows to ensure that all items in the project board are properly marked and organized.

The **_Documentation Manager_** is responsible for creating a well-formatted web page (`readme.md` file) using Markdown language.

The **_Development Manager_** is responsible for writing a C code in `code.c` and configuring a GitHub Action with a workflow to execute the code. 

The **_Delivery Manager_** is responsible for updating the code section of the web page with the code from `code.c`. Additionally, they are responsible for obtaining a workflow status badge for the code and inserting the resulting image using markdown below the code snippet.

The **_Personnel Manager_** is responsible for updating the contributors section of the web page (`readme.md` file) by displaying all the necessary information, including the image, user, name, and content from each file in the `_stu` folder in the correct format.

The **_Promotion Manager_** is responsible for promoting the team's repository by adding a link to the repository on the web page and including the last updated time at the bottom of the page.
